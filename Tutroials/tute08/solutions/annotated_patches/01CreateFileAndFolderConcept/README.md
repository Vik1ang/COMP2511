# Create File

We want to create a concept of what a file/directory represents as our model.

A TreeItem behaves like a controller, it has access to the view (TreeCell) and we'll want to give it access to our model (File/Directory).

Look into each patch to see comments ordered by the prefix.  At this phase we don't really know what else we'll need or what is common (I guess) so just try to get a rough structure.
