# Cleanup File Path Tree Item

Now we've abstracted we can go clean up, go and remove all that ugly code from FilePathTreeItem and try to replace it the best we can.  We can't expand folders properly yet so we'll want to do that in a moment.

Just do a bit removal of all the logic and add back event handlers for each action.
