# Tutorial 01

## A. Introduction

Your tutor will run a short introduction/icebreaker activity.

## B. Solving Design Problems

* In groups, your tutor is going to give you a design problem to think about and discuss.
* Come back together, and reflect with your tutor on how you came up with those answers.

## C. Hello Java and Git Revision

Your tutor is going to import the `tute01` code into VSCode and will complete the Hello World program. Things to note:

* The JDK version used (java-11-openjdk on the CSE system; possibly jdk-11 on your laptop).
* How new classes are created.
* How VSCode's autocomplete gives detailed information about the methods that can be invoked.
* Where the output appears.

After completing the program, your tutor will `git add`, `commit`, and `push` the changes.

## D. Java Programming

1. Inside a new file called `Sum.java`, write a program that uses the `Scanner` class which reads in a line of numbers separated by spaces, and sums them.

2. Inside a new file `Shouter.java`, Write a program that stores a message and has methods for getting the message, updating the message and printing it out in all caps. Write a `main()` method for testing this class.

## E. C vs Python vs Java

As a class, discuss the following questions:

1. What are some similarities and differences between C, Python and Java - stylistically, structurally but also what they are used for.

2. What is a class? What is an object? Based on your experience with Python, how are classes normally used?

3. How do C, Python and Java compare to other languages you may have encountered at CSE or elsewhere? Is the best way of doing something in one language necessarily the best way of doing it in another?

4. What is an IDE?
